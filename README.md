## Requirements
- Android SDK 17+

## Usage

Add to your root build.gradle:
```Groovy
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```

Add the dependency:
```Groovy
dependencies {
	implementation 'com.github.Yalantis:Kalendar:v0.0.2-alpha'
}
```

## How to use this library in your project?

First of all, add `Kalendar` to the xml layout of your activity, remember, you can specify any width but height always will be wrap_content. So it looks like that:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<com.yalantis.view.Kalendar
	android:id="@+id/kalendar"
	android:layout_width="match_parent"
	android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```

## Customization

For customization ui Kalendar you can use such attributes value :

To change text in drag area you can use
```xml
<com.yalantis.kalendar.view.Kalendar
	...
	app:dragText="Sample"
	...
```

To change height of drag area you need to set value to dragHeight in dp. The default value for dragHeight is 32dp.
```xml
 <com.yalantis.kalendar.view.Kalendar
 	...	
        app:dragHeight="16dp" 
        ...
/>
```
Change drag text size you can set value to dragTextSize in sp. The default value for dragTextSize is 12sp
```xml
<com.yalantis.kalendar.view.Kalendar
 	...	
        app:dragTextSize="16sp" 
        ...
/>
```

Change color of text in drag area you need to set value to dragTextColor as a reference to the color. The default value for dragTextColor is @color/drag_text_color which is #ababab
```xml
<com.yalantis.kalendar.view.Kalendar
 	...	
        app:dragTextColor="@android:color/black" 
        ...
/>
```

Also you can change drag area background color by simply use dragColor attribute. The default color is @color/light_gray which is #dcdfe1
```xml
<com.yalantis.kalendar.view.Kalendar
 	...	
        app:dragColor="@android:color/black" 
        ...
/>
```

Kalendar has collapse() and expand() methods which collapse/expand current selected month
```Kotlin
kalendar.collapse()
kalendar.expand()
```

Kalendar has getMonthAt(position: Int) method which returns month from view pager's adapter by position argument
```Kotlin
kalendar.getMonthAt(position: Int) 
```

Also, you can realize automatic swipe using swipeMonth(isSwipeToEnd: Boolean) method:
```Kotlin
kalendar.swipeMonth(false) - swipe to left
kalendar.swipeMonth(true) - swipe to right
```

Also you can create `KalendarListener` and use all the methods of the `KalendarListener`. This interface provides empty implementations of the methods. For any custom animation callback handle you can create any custom listener that cares only about a subset of the methods of this listener can simply implement the interface directly:
```
fun onDayClick(date: Date)
fun onStateChanged(isCollapsed: Boolean)
fun onHeightChanged(newHeight: Int)
fun onMonthChanged(forward: Boolean, date: Date? = null)
fun onSizeMeasured(monthPage: MonthPage, collapsedHeight: Int, totalHeight: Int)
```

## Let us know!

We’d be really happy if you sent us links to your projects where you use our component. Just send an email to github@yalantis.com And do let us know if you have any questions or suggestion regarding the animation.
